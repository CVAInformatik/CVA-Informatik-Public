Currently  PrimefactorFFTcpp compiles for debug  and run on Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition for both x64 and x32

Compiliing for Release (both x64 and x86) causes test16MillerRabin() to fail one of my own checks...

Intrigued I compiled it under Ubuntu in WSL with g++,   the test16MillerRabin() case works, soft of, 
for some witnesses  it hits my checks, for other it seems to work.  

I suspect this could be a bug of mine, and not, say, an optimizer induced defect.
